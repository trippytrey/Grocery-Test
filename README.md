# Grocery-Test

This test was designed to get acquainted with integrating HTML and PHP.

The small project was given in class to prompt the user, asking them how many bottles of milk they bought and how many bottles of beer as well.

When the numbers are entered, the user presses submit, posting the values to the .php file procOrder1.

This shows a receipt of the transaction, giving values for the drinks and asking if the user is over 21 and if they want the items delivered.

If they are not over 21, the value of beer is set to 0 and the site will tell the user they are not over 21 so they cannot order that specific item.  Depending on if the "Delivery" box is checked will determine if the items are delivered or left at the store for pickup.
